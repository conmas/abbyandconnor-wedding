# abbyandconnor-wedding

Abby and Connor are getting married, and this website is the home for updates and resources for everyone attending.

Rather than basing our wedding website on a prebuilt Squarespace theme or some template from the Knot, Abby and Connor designed and developed this website from scratch using Connor's newfangled web development skills.

Connor is still new to web development, so if anything doesn't work correctly or seems broken, feel free to [let him know](mailto:cnnr@icloud.com?subject=Something%20seems%20broken%20on%20your%20wedding%20website&body=Describe%20what\'s%20happening%20here.%20Please%20make%20sure%20to%20include%20the%20browser%20and%20device%20you\'re%20using.%20Thanks%20for%20the%20help!)!

Designed by Abby and Connor in Chicago. Built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), and [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html). Written in [Coda](https://www.panic.com/coda/) for macOS and iOS. Source code available on [Github](https://github.com/conmas/omaha-abbyandconnor-wedding/). Feel free to contribute!
